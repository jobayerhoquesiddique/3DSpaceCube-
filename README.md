🚀 3D SpaceCube Simulator with OpenGL and C++

Welcome to the 3D Space Navigation Simulator built using OpenGL and C++! This interactive simulation allows users to control a spaceship in a 3D environment, with intuitive movement and rotation controls. The project demonstrates basic 3D transformations and rendering techniques using OpenGL.

🌟 Key Features:
	•	🛸 Interactive 3D Navigation: Move and rotate a spaceship in a 3D space with real-time controls.
	•	🎮 Perspective & Parallel Projection: Toggle between perspective and orthographic (parallel) projection modes for different visual effects.
	•	🚀 Spaceship Movement: Move the spaceship along the X, Y, and Z axes using simple keyboard controls.
	•	🔄 Real-Time Rotation: Rotate the spaceship around the X and Y axes for an immersive experience.
	•	💨 Smooth Rendering: Utilize OpenGL for real-time rendering and dynamic transformations.

⌨️ Keyboard Controls:
	•	W ➡️ Move spaceship up.
	•	S ➡️ Move spaceship down.
	•	A ➡️ Move spaceship left.
	•	D ➡️ Move spaceship right.
	•	Q ➡️ Move spaceship forward.
	•	E ➡️ Move spaceship backward.
	•	Arrow Keys ➡️ Rotate spaceship around the X and Y axes.
	•	P ➡️ Toggle between perspective and parallel projection modes.
	•	Esc ➡️ Exit the application.

💻 System Requirements:
	•	OpenGL (with GLUT and GLEW libraries for window management and rendering).
	•	A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang).

📦 Getting Started:
	1.	Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
	2.	Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler (make sure you have OpenGL installed).
	3.	Run the program and use the keyboard controls to navigate the spaceship.
